<p style="font-size: 14px!important">
Deep learning (DL) has achieved great success in many application domains. However, how to ensure the reliability and security of DL system remains an open problem. For example, an attacker could add adversarial perturbations often imperceptible to human eyes to an image to cause a deep neural network (DNN) to misclassify perturbed images. Traditional software represents its logic as control flows crafted by human knowledge, while a DNN characterizes its behaviors by the weights of neuron edges and the nonlinear activation functions (determined by the training data). Therefore, detecting erroneous behaviors in DNNs is different from those of traditional software in nature, which necessitates effective analysis, testing and verification approaches. We plan to take a multi-pronged approach to explore deeper understanding of defects (bugs) and adversarial examples in DL systems, and methods to guarantee the reliability and security of DL systems.

<p style="font-size: 14px!important">
Just like huge amounts of data on the web enabled Big Data applications, now large repositories of programs (e.g. open source code on GitHub) enable a new class of applications that leverage these repositories of "Big Code". Using Big Code means to automatically learn from existing code in order to solve software engineering tasks such as predicting software bugs, predicting program behavior, or automatically generating new code.</p>
